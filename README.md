# Automating Translation 

This GitHub contains the official repository (mtdev) for supporting materials and resources for the book **"Automating Translation"**. Translation technology is essential for translation students, practising translators, and those working as part of the language services industry, but looming above others are the tools for automating translation: machine translation (MT) and, more recently, Generative AI based on Large Language Models (LLMs).

## About the Book

"Automating Translation", authored by leading experts, demystifies MT, explaining its origins, its training data, how neural MT and LLMs work, how to measure their quality, how translators interact with contemporary systems for automating translation, and how readers can build their own MT or LLM. In later chapters, the scope of the book expands to look more broadly at translation automation in audiovisual translation and localisation. Importantly, the book also examines the sociotechnical context, focusing on ethics and sustainability. Enhanced with activities, further reading and resource links, including online support material on the Routledge Translation studies portal, this is an essential textbook for students of translation studies, trainee and practising translators and users of MT and multilingual LLMs.

## Target Audience

- **Students of Translation or Humanities**: Gain insights into the inner workings of NMT and LLMs, equipping you with the knowledge to critically assess and engage with translation technologies.
- **Practicing Translators and Language Service Providers**: Understand the technological advancements shaping the industry and how they can be leveraged to enhance translation quality and efficiency.
- **Translation Technology Enthusiasts**: Explore the practicalities of NMT systems, from conceptualization to implementation, and learn how to evaluate MT outputs effectively.

## Repository Contents

This repository serves as a companion to the book, providing a range of resources that complement the concepts discussed:

- **Sample Code**: Experiment with real-life NMT model examples, understand their architecture, and learn how to tweak them for different translation tasks.
- **Datasets**: Access curated datasets ideal for training and testing NMT systems, along with guidance on how to use them effectively.
- **Tutorials and Guides**: Step-by-step instructions to get you started on building and evaluating your own NMT system, tailored for beginners and advanced users alike.
- **Additional Readings**: A collection of recommended articles, papers, and resources for further exploration into the subject matter.
